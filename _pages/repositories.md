- [MetaBox](https://github.com/GMC-DRL/MetaBox): The first benchmark platform expressly tailored for developing and evaluating MetaBBO-RL methods, which is accepted at NeurIPS 2023.
- [Symbol](https://github.com/GMC-DRL/Symbol): The python implementation of our paper [SYMBOL](https://openreview.net/forum?id=vLJcd43U7a&noteId=Z5vpEil2mt), which is accepted as a poster paper at ICLR 2024. This is a novel MetaBBO paragidm against the recent proposed ones, refer to the paper for detail.
- [Neur-ELA](https://github.com/GMC-DRL/Neur-ELA): The official code for [Neural Exploratory Landscape Analysis](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2408.10672). It is an automatic extraction of optimization status features through a landscape analyser parameterized by a two-stage attention-based neural network, refer to the paper for detail.
- [RL-DAS](https://github.com/GMC-DRL/RL-DAS): The official code for [Deep Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Algorithm Selection: A Proof-of-Principle Study on Differential Evolution](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10496708). It is a DRL-based dynamic algorithm selection framework, refer to the paper for detail.
- [GLEET](https://github.com/GMC-DRL/GLEET): The official code for [Auto-configuring Exploration-Exploitation Tradeoff in Evolutionary Computation via Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3638529.3653996). It is a DRL-based framework that autonomously configures and adapts the exploration-exploitation tradeoff throughout the EC search process., refer to the paper for detail.
- [Awesome-MetaBBO](https://github.com/GMC-DRL/Awesome-MetaBBO): This is a collection of MetaBBO papers and their corresponding code resources.
- Coming soon
